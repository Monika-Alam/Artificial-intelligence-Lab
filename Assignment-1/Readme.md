This Python script performs several operations on a user's full name input. The operations include:

- Counting vowels and consonants
- Displaying ASCII values of characters
- Reversing the name
- Checking if the name is a palindrome
- Identifying unique letters and sorting them manually
- Finding the first non-repeating character

This is part of a lab assignment to demonstrate string manipulation, character handling, and logic implementation in Python.
